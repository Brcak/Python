# YouTube Video Link Grabber and Downloader

This project consists of two Python scripts: `link_grabber.py` and `YT_downloader.py`. The first script allows you to grab video links from a YouTube channel, while the second script downloads those videos. Both scripts are built using `tkinter` for the GUI and `yt-dlp` for interacting with YouTube.

## Features

### `link_grabber.py`
- **Grab Video Links**: Enter a YouTube channel URL, and the script will extract all video links from that channel.
- **Save Links**: The extracted links are saved to a text file (`video_links.txt`) in the same directory as the script.
- **Simple GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with `tkinter`.

### `YT_downloader.py`
- **Import Links**: Import video links from a text file (e.g., the one generated by `link_grabber.py`).
- **Download Videos**: Download videos from the imported links in the best available quality.
- **Stylish Interface**: A dark-themed interface with a terminal-like effect for logging and feedback.
- **Download Management**: Keeps track of downloaded videos in a text file (`downloaded_videos.txt`).
