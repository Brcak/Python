YouTube Video Link Grabber and Downloader
------------------------------------
This project consists of two Python scripts: link_grabber.py and YT_downloader.py. The first script allows you to grab video links from a YouTube channel, while the second script downloads those videos. Both scripts are built using tkinter for the GUI and yt-dlp for interacting with YouTube.
------------------------------------
Features:
Grab Video Links: Enter a YouTube channel URL, and the script will extract all video links from that channel.
Save Links: The extracted links are saved to a text file (video_links.txt) in the same directory as the script.
Simple GUI: A user-friendly interface built with tkinter.

YT_downloader.py
Import Links: Import video links from a text file (e.g., the one generated by link_grabber.py).
Download Videos: Download videos from the imported links in the best available quality.
Hacker-Style Interface: A dark-themed, hacker-style terminal effect for logging and feedback.
Download Management: Keeps track of downloaded videos in a text file (downloaded_videos.txt).
